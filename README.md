_Type-level Routing API for Hyper_

The `purescript-hyper-routing` package brings a Servant-style routing type
API to Hyper. By using *routing types* you get static guarantees about having
handled all cases. You also get a lot of stuff for free, such as type-safe
parameters for handlers, and automatically generated type-safe URIs to
endpoints.

## Usage

For the documentation on how to use this package, please head over to the
extensions section in the Hyper documentation, and the part on [Type-Level
Routing](http://hyper.wickstrom.tech/extensions/type-level-routing/index.html).

## API Documentation

This library's API documentation is published [on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-hyper-routing).
